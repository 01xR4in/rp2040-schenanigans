# rp2040-schenanigans
A simple repo about me doing stuff with rp2040 microcontrollers

## Get started
This is not a serious project, more like a knowledge base about me doing stuff with some controllers. Should you use this KB ? Probably not, it's messy and has no point other than store some 

My current setup is:

- RP2040 Zero (from [Aliexpress](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005007650325892.html))
- 1.25 MicroPython Bootloader for [RPI PICO](https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO/)
- VScode with the [MicroPico](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulober.pico-w-go) extention 

## Current programs:

- blinky.py - Simple LED Blinking script


##Â Roadmap:

- HID Stuff
- More in-depth pin management
